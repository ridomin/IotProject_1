# Add script to install external libs in this file.
# If you haven't built the project container, run command "Remote-Containers: Reopen in container" to open the project in your customized docker image.
# If you change Dockerfile or this script after your project container has been built, run command "Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container" to rebuild the docker image and apply your customization settings.
# (Notice that the command "Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container" only appears when the project is in remote side.)

# Samples:
# apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
# apt-get install -y git
